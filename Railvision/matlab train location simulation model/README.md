locationexperiment.slx is the matlab simulink file, which is responsible for the system's train locations simulation.

The randompoints file is the one being used by simulink for the locatoins. It firstly has to be imported into matlab then set location=the file for the simulink to access the locations 

These locations will be viewed in the web system as train's current locations via thingspeak
